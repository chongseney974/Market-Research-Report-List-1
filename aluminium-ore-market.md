<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aluminium Ore Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-air Aluminium Ore</li><li>Underground Aluminium Ore</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aluminium ore market primarily consists of two types: open-air and underground mining. Open-air aluminium ore extraction involves surface mining, where ore is accessed by removing overlying soil and rock, making it cost-effective and efficient for large-scale operations. Underground mining, on the other hand, involves extracting ore from deep beneath the earth's surface, often used when deposits are located at significant depths. Both methods cater to the global demand for aluminium, with open-air being more common due to lower costs and higher accessibility.</p></p>
